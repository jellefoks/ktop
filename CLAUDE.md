Add changes you make to the changelog including tests you run.

After making changes to ktop.py, always re-run `./setup.sh` to update the system-wide `ktop` command.

read ~/Documents/session.md - when you finish a task message me on the Ktop workspace and then poll for incoming session
messages every 30s to get instructions on what to do next
